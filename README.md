## üìå Tasks

### Group Development and Topic Selection

* You must work in a **group of 4 people** for these projects.
* Your group **does not need** to be in a single location or in the same individual presentation section (i.e., alpha/beta).
* If you selected a preference for choosing your own group, you are responsible for that.
* If you chose to be assigned to a group, your group members will be assigned randomly.
* If you have any specific preferences or requests, please email the professor as soon as possible.

### Approved Project Areas

The first group project will focus on algorithms or problems in the following areas:

* Cryptography
* Arithmetic, Primality, and Factoring
* Divide and Conquer Algorithms
* Graph Search
* Shortest Path Algorithms on General or Directed Graphs

**Instructions:**

* Select a general topic.
* Identify **two specific problems or tasks** within that concept.
* Recommended: pick two **medium or hard problems** from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) or select problems from the textbook not covered in class.

### üì• Team and Idea Submission (DONE)

**Due: Monday 05/19/25**
Submit via **Gradescope** a 1-page PDF that includes:

* Team member names
* Description of your concept and problems
* Inputs and outputs for each problem
* Citation of the source(s) of the problems

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Development

* Implement your algorithm in a language of your choice.
* Include any special data structures required by the algorithm.
* You may use standard built-in types (e.g., lists, dictionaries).
* For advanced functions (e.g., NumPy SVD), appropriate libraries may be used‚Äî**acknowledge all packages**.
* Your code must be able to **accept any correct input**.

  * Use a file or command line argument (not hard-coded).
* Code should be **well-documented**, with:

  * A header with team member names
  * Appropriate in-line comments

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è Algorithm Timing

Perform timing analysis of your algorithm and include in your report:

* Theoretical **Big-O complexity**
* **Graph of actual performance** (empirical analysis)
* Measure only your algorithm (not input reading time)

---

### üìù Report

Submit a **short report** (no page limit) with the following:

* Description of the overall concept
* Description of the two selected problems
* Your algorithms for each problem
* Complexity analysis
* Example of each problem being solved
* Timing results (theoretical + empirical)
* Project reflection (what worked, what didn‚Äôt, what to change)
* Acknowledgements
* Citations (use a standard format)

Submit the report as a **PDF** with your final project.

---

### üé§ Presentation

Prepare a **10-minute presentation**. Presentations will occur on:

* **June 4th or June 11th (during class time)**
* **All team members must participate**

Your presentation should include:

* Brief identification of the overall concept
* Identification of the two problems
* Detailed presentation of **one** of the problems
* Timing and complexity results
* (Optional) Second problem solution (if time allows)

Submit a **PDF of your slides** along with your final project.

---

### ü§ù Teamwork Summary

Along with your other materials, submit a **1-page PDF** describing each team member‚Äôs contribution.

---

## üì§ Submission Checklist

Upload the following to **Gradescope**:

* Report (`.pdf`)
* Presentation Slides (`.pdf`)
* Teamwork Document (`.pdf`)
* Readme (`.txt`)
* Code

**Important:** Do not upload an entire directory. Only upload the listed files.

**Due: Friday, June 13th**
